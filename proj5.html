		<h2>Plant Life</h2>
		<p>Plant life was an interactive project where an app device interacts and receives information from a smart flower pot. The flower pot has an automatic watering feature which could be controlled with the app as well as a smart detection system which will notify the user if the plant is dehydrated, needs more sunlight, or any other problems concerning the health of the potted plant. The app will also give all known information about the potted plant along with a basic guide on growing each specific plant synced up.</p>
