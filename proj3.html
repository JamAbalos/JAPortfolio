		<h2>Pet Steps</h2>
		<p>Pet Steps was an interactive project where a wearable device interacts and sends information to a mobile device. This app is designed to monitor the activity as well as track the location of a smart pet collar tracked via GPS. It gives the user notification if their pet is too inactive or not getting enough rest along with information about their pet's current location in case they wander off and get lost. The user can also set notifications for important dates and reminders or just note down important information they want.</p>
